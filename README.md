this project Optimized Waste Collection Routing in Cities Using Ant Colony Optimization we used GA , ACO ,GA-ACO , ACO-GA 

we included a GUI  for each algorithm

this is the ACO

this two are the out put of the GA

this is the out put of GA-ACO the out put is the best compared to the other algorithms (the GUI may make something strang close the extra windows and continue)

the algorithm works based on the edges as each node has a spasific numbers of Neighbors that it can connect to we used the distance as the weight and it was effected by a traffic_factor

abd in ACO there was the pheromones and the evaporation
